## About this project 
This project aims to implement **Java** and **Selenium WebDriver** along side with **Maven** and **Page Object Model**. 

## Maven
**Maven** - addresses two aspects of building software: how software is built, and its dependencies (XML file). 

## XML 
**XML** - is a markup language and file format for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data. It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

## Page Object Model
**Page Object Model**, also known as POM, is a design pattern in Selenium that creates an object repository for storing all web elements. It is useful in reducing code duplication and improves test case maintenance. In Page Object Model, consider each web page of an application as a class file.

**In *src* you will find:**
* main/java/pages - for pages in the application; 
* test/java - tests for Application Under Test;

**In *resources*:**
* chromedriver.exe (for Windows);

**XML file and dependencies** in *pom.xml*
